# yoRadio Fusion – ESP32 Web Radio
**Customized ESP32-S3 internet radio with advanced display drivers and Web UI**

It includes custom display drivers for NV3041A, GC9A01, GC9A01_I80 devices.
Supports namedays, multiple VU-meter layouts, theme upload, and high-bitrate audio playback.

This project is based on **ёRadio v0.9.720** by e2002:  
https://github.com/e2002/yoradio  
📌 *Reading the original documentation is strongly recommended.*

## ⚠️ Important: SD Card Compatibility (Required File Replacement)

For the following hardware models, **SD card support will NOT work** unless you replace  
`sdmanager.cpp` and `sdmanager.h` with the versions provided in this repository:

- **ESP32-2432S028**
- **Guition JC4827W543C**
- **GC9A01_ROUND**  (not working yet)
- **GC9A01_I80_ROUND**  (not working yet)

The correct SD manager files are located inside each display’s specific subfolder under:
boards_samples/<display_model>/


### Why is this required?
These boards use different SPI/I80/QSPI line mappings or bus arbitration methods, and therefore require a board-specific SD manager implementation with proper mutex locking and bus handling.

### Notes
- Only **sdmanager.cpp** and **sdmanager.h** must be replaced.  
- The same subfolder also contains additional display drivers (QSPI, I80, touch, etc.), but **these are already included** in yoRadio Fusion and **do not need** to be replaced.  
- Those files are provided only for convenience, in case you want to use the same displays with other yoRadio firmware versions.


## ⚠️ Compatibility & Recommended Kernel Versions

This firmware cannot be used on devices without PSRAM.

Recommended ESP32 Arduino Core Versions

To ensure full driver compatibility and avoid audio stack instability:

ESP32-S3: Arduino Core 3.3.3 (recommended)

ESP32 (classic): Arduino Core 3.3.3 (recommended)

## 🔧 IDF MOD Compatibility

The required IDF patches for high-bitrate audio playback are included in the  
`Audio_IDF_MOD/CORE_3.3.3-IDF_ver5.5` directory.

Separate versions are provided for:

- **ESP32**
- **ESP32-S3**

These patches must be applied when using **Arduino Core 3.3.3**, as both platforms
still rely on the corresponding ESP-IDF audio components that the modifications were designed for.

## 🎚 VU Meter Calibration

yoRadio Fusion includes a fully tunable VU engine with dynamic range shaping, soft-knee compression, smoothing and gain controls.  
These parameters allow the VU meter to behave naturally across different hardware, audio sources and display sizes.

### 🔧 Parameter Overview

**Floor (%)**  
Noise threshold. Below this level the VU does not move.  
Lower it to make very quiet passages visible.

**Ceil (%)**  
Upper limit (headroom). Above this value the signal is compressed.  
`100%` = no ceiling, full dynamic range.

**Expo (γ)** – Curve steepness  
- `1.0` → linear  
- `> 1.0` → compresses low end, emphasizes peaks  
- `< 1.0` → expands low end, makes quiet parts more “alive”

**Gain**  
Overall multiplier.  
Increase if the VU appears too low, decrease if it constantly maxes out.

**Knee (%)**  
Soft entry threshold.  
Higher values → smoother and less “snappy” transitions.

### 🔁 Processing Order in the Engine
`normalize(floor..ceil) → smoothstep(knee) → powf(expo) → * gain`

---

## ⚡ Quick Setup (4 Steps)

1. **Floor**  
   Lower it until you see movement even in quiet sections.  
   - Small displays: 20–40%  
   - Large VUs: 10–25%

2. **Ceil**  
   Start with **100%**.  
   If peaks slam into the top, reduce to **90–95%**.

3. **Expo**  
   - VU moves only at the top → decrease (`1.6 → 1.2`)  
   - Too much low-end activity → increase (`1.0 → 1.3–1.6`)

4. **Gain**  
   Adjust last to fit the full range.  
   Increase if it's too low, decrease if it hits the ceiling.

---

## 🎛 Fine Tuning

**Knee**  
- **0–5%** → fast, snappy, more aggressive  
- **10–20%** → smoother, less jittery motion

**Smoothing Controls**  
- `alphaUp` → smaller = slower rise, larger = faster  
- `alphaDown` → larger = slower decay  
- `peakUp / peakDown` → peak indicator sensitivity

---

## 🩺 Symptoms → Fixes

| Symptom               | What to Adjust |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| **“Barely moves”**    | Floor ↓, Expo ↓, Gain ↑ |
| **“Only lights at top”** | Expo ↓, Ceil = 100%, Gain ↓ |
| **“Jumpy / nervous”** | Knee ↑ (10–15%), alphaUp ↓, alphaDown ↑ |
| **“Always maxed out”** | Gain ↓ or Ceil ↓ to 95% |


## 🌍 Languages & Regional Settings  
*(contribution by **Tamás Várai**)*

yoRadio Fusion includes built-in languages and regional formats:  
**HU, PL, GR, EN, RU, NL, SK, UA**

Language can be selected in `myoptions.h`:

🔤 Font System (Adafruit_GFX 5×7 font)

The program uses the built-in Adafruit_GFX font system, which scales a 5×7 bitmap font (glcdfont.c).
If your characters display incorrectly (e.g., WiFi / speaker icons, accented letters), you must replace glcdfont.c with the correct version for your language.

Locations

Arduino IDE:
Documents/Arduino/libraries/Adafruit_GFX_Library/glcdfont.c

PlatformIO:
yoRadio/.pio/libdeps/esp32-s3-devkitc1-n16r8/Adafruit GFX Library/glcdfont.c

Custom language-specific font files (included in this repo)
yoRadio/locale/glcdfont/EN, NL, CZ/glcdfont.c
yoRadio/locale/glcdfont/GR/glcdfont.c
yoRadio/locale/glcdfont/HU/glcdfont.c
yoRadio/locale/glcdfont/PL, SK/glcdfont.c
yoRadio/locale/glcdfont/RU/glcdfont.c
yoRadio/locale/glcdfont/UA/glcdfont.c


Replace the original file with the version matching your selected language.

## 🎉 Nameday Display

*(contribution by **Tamás Várai**)*

The firmware can display namedays for the following languages:
HU, PL, GR

Enable and select language in myoptions.h:

#define NAMEDAYS_FILE HU


Nameday data files are located in:

yoRadio/locale/namedays/namedays_HU.h
yoRadio/locale/namedays/namedays_PL.h
yoRadio/locale/namedays/namedays_GR.h
